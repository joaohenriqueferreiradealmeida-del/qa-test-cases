## 🚀 About Me
I am transitioning into the QA (Quality Assurance) field, focusing on manual testing and test case design.

I am building this portfolio to demonstrate my ability to analyze requirements, think critically about edge cases, and document test scenarios in a clear and structured way.

This repository will continue to evolve as I expand my knowledge and practical experience in QA.
