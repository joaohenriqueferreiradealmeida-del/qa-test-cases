# QA Test Cases Portfolio

This repository contains manual test cases created for study and portfolio purposes.

## 📌 About this project
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Software testing fundamentals
- Manual test case design
- Bug-oriented and user-focused thinking
- QA documentation best practices

The test cases are written to reflect real-world QA scenarios, focusing on clarity, coverage, and business rules validation.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Covered

- User Registration (Sign Up)
- Input validation
- Error messages and edge cases
